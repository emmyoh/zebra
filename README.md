# Zebra

A vector database for querying meaningfully similar data.
The database can be extended to support documents of many data types; at the moment, text, image, and audio data are supported.

### The name

Zebras (like other equines) make a 'neigh' sound. The database performs a nearest-*neigh*bour search to find similar data.

## Installation
Zebra is intended for use as a library. You can add it as a dependency to a Rust project with the following command:
```bash
cargo add --git "https://github.com/emmyoh/zebra"
```

Additionally, a command-line interface (CLI) exists for usage in the terminal.

With the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) installed, run the following command:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/emmyoh/zebra --features="cli"
```

You should specify the features relevant to your use case. For example, if you're interested in using the Zebra CLI on an Apple silicon device, run:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/emmyoh/zebra --features="cli,accelerate,metal"
```

## Features
* `default_db` - Provides default configurations for databases.
* `accelerate` - Uses Apple's Accelerate framework when running on Apple operating systems.
* `cuda` - Enables GPU support with Nvidia cards.
* `mkl` - Uses Intel oneMKL with Intel CPUs and GPUs.
* `metal` - Enables GPU support for Apple silicon machines.
* `sixel` - Prints images in Sixel format when using the CLI with compatible terminals.
* `cli` - Provides a command-line interface to Zebra.
